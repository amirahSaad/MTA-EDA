## Introduction

We have the client (NYC Emergency Management) and they has a Kids safety event in New York City each year, and to concurrently build awareness and reach for our event.
And they order from us to help them to find which best station to the placement of their staff and volunteers to hand out preparedness publications and materials to the public.

## Backstory:

NYC Emergency Management has an annual Kids safety event at the beginning of the September each year.
hand out preparedness publications and materials at a public fair (the kids safety event).
and it's annual Kids Safety Event that talk about safety topics, including bicycle safety, bullying prevention, tips on staying safe while surfing the Internet..etc

Our task was to use subway data from NYCâ€™s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) to help NYC Emergency Management optimize the placement of their staff and volunteers, such that they hand out preparedness publications and materials to the public , ideally from those who will attend the event and contribute to their cause.

## Setup:

I will use the MTA metro turnstile database, And the database from (http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html)
The three months of June,July and Augest seem to be enough lead time before the September for people to be able to come to kids safety event into their calendar.

## Tools:

I will use Numpy , panads, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Goals:

What would a minimum viable product (MVP) look like for this project?
The minimum viable product is to find the 10 busiest station and visualize it.
